# Day - 00
## Learnings from Blogs and Videos:

### Blogs
#### Importance of Coaching and Being Coachable:
It was a wonderfully inspiring blog which taught us that we should be an empty slate, a mirror that can reflect everything that our coaches teach. Being able to reflect those methods and teachings and improving or honing these skills over time will only help one grow in their field. An inspiring coach can pull up a man from the depths of failure and put him on a path to success.
#### The Pursuit of Passion:
“Happiness is the key to success”, a few words that have a really deep meaning. With happiness comes the will to work. With work, a person will become successful. But working for just the sake of working does not bring any positive effect or happiness to a person. Being passionate, surrounding yourself with like minded, goal oriented people will help you boost your morale and achieve this happiness, this life that we all dream of!
#### Time - key to success:
Day after day, hour after hour, minute after minute, we keep thinking about the question “What if…?”. “What if I could play like him?”, “What if I can score as high as them?”, “What if I had so much money?, all these questions are valid but the most crucial point missing with them is “What if I start doing it right now!”. Time is a cruel but necessary evil, the one who learns to tame it shall not fear anything in their life. With time management, a person can gain the power to control the outcome of their life, create passion, and live their dreams.

### Videos
The videos shared with us all had a powerful meaning. Learning from your mistakes, repetition for success and gaining skill by doing small things but doing them perfectly will help us grow our personality. These videos were basically a look back to the blogs, the importance of being coachable and having a good coach, having passion in what you do and what you want to achieve and investing the time required to increase your skills.

Going through these blogs and videos helped me understand a bit more clearly what I want to achieve in the future.
